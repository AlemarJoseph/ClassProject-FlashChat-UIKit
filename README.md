In this project we created an app that involves Firebase, UITableViews and UI|UX .xib files.

Things I learned:
-	The iOS Navigation Controller
-	Swift Loops
-	Cocoapods and the Swift Package Manager
-	Firebase Firestore as a Cloud Database
-	Firebase Authentication
-	iOS Table Views
-	Creating custom UI with .xib files 

This was an amazing experience and definitely one of the most difficult projects I have been a part of.
